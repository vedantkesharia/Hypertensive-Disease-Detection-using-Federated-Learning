Cardiovascular diseases, including hypertensive conditions, impose a substantial global health burden. Timely detection and precise diagnosis are critical for effective management. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely utilized diagnostic tool for assessing heart function.However, manual ECG chart interpretation remains time-consuming and requires specialized expertise and also it is difficult for normal people to understand the ECG reports. The solution propose a machine learning approach to automate ECG analysis by transforming paper-based ECG records into a concise 1-D signal. The methodology encompasses data acquisition, feature extraction, dimension reduction, and the implementation of diverse classifiers. Through the analysis of key features,accurate classification of cardiac conditions, including myocardial infarction, abnormal heartbeat, and healthy status can be achieved.Additionally it provides summarization of ECG images so that a normal person can understand it. The resulting model serves as a valuable tool for realtime hypertensive disease prediction, empowering clinicians to efficiently assess patients heart health and enhance clinical outcomes.
